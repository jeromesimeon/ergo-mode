This is ergo-mode, the Emacs mode for editing Ergo code.

Information about Ergo can be found at: [http://ergo.accordproject.org](http://ergo.accordproject.org)

# Credits & Disclaimer

This is a heavily hacked Emacs mode based on [go-mode.el](https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el)

This is meant as an experiment to show some level of Ergo syntax highlighting and code indentation. This hasn't been heavily tested, but feel free to try it. Contributions are very welcome.

## Installation

To install ergo-mode, place `ergo-mode.el` in a directory of your choice, add it to your Emacs load path and require `'ergo-mode`:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/place/where/you/put/it/")
    (require 'ergo-mode)
