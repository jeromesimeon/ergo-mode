This is ergo-mode, the Emacs mode for editing Ergo code.

# Credits & Disclaimer

This is a heavily hacked version of the go-mode at: https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el

This is mostly to support some level of Ergo syntax highlighting and code indentation. This hasn't been heavily tested, but feel free to try it. Contributions are very welcome.

## Installation

To install ergo-mode, place `ergo-mode.el` in a directory of your choice, add it to your load path and require `'ergo-mode`:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/place/where/you/put/it/")
    (require 'ergo-mode)
